## How to generate the mock code?

In this project, to test, we need to generate mock code for the use-case, repository, and database.

```bash
# Generate mock code for the usecase and repository
mockery --dir=domain --output=domain/mocks --outpkg=mocks --all

# Generate mock code for the database
mockery --dir=mongo --output=mongo/mocks --outpkg=mocks --all
```
